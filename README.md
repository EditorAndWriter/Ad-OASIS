Mainstream advertisers often seek automated access to the total available market (TAM). Uniform workflow specifications will increase the attractiveness of each individual publishers' inventory.
## Scope
This specification establishes commonality between various implementations of an onboard advertising workflow. Implementation consistancy will facilitate relationships with other entities in the advertising industry workflow such as well-known verification providers.
## Terms and Definitions  
**Well-Known Verification Providers**
vendors of anti-fraud services - examples include Moat, Double-Verify, IAS
**OMID SDK**
IAB Open Measurement Software Development Kit 
## Business Requirements
Onboard advertising ecosystems shall support commercial message presentations that are manditory. This would include advertisements that are presented automatically when a passenger initially interacts with a seat back interface. This would also include advertisements that are presented automatically when a passenger owned device first connects to an onboard system.
